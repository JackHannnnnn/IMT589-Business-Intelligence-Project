# IMT 589 Business Intelligence Project
This is a project I completed in the course IMT 589 Business Intelligence.

The primary components of this project are as follows:
- Built a **SQL data warehouse database** containing _SQL staging tables, a SQL dimensional data model, SQL views_ which supported data visualizations and handled data challenges like grouping, filtering, specialized calculations
- Developed **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) packages** for performing the task of **ETL** using necessary SQL codes like multiple joins, identity column insertion, CASE, SUBSTRING, CAST, ISNULL function
- Used **Tableau** to build data visualizations which could help to answer business questions
